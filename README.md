How do I approach designing software?
o What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
The reading resource has given me design skills of creating 2D and 3D objects,
adding realistic textures, and light source to simulate a realistic object. These
skills helped me create a 3D glass jar with a lid. I was also able to create a 3D
glass plate. Additionally, I was able to create a light source which allowed me to
cast a shadow to make my objects even more realistic.
o What design process did you follow for your project work?
My first design process was to ensure I was aligned with the requirements with
project rubric. I made my code well-organized in the aspects of indenting,
commenting on the code, and the order in which I placed each of my functions.
For example, I placed all my header files at the very beginning of my code, then
the function prototypes, and my global variables.
o How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I strongly believe having good organizational tactics, commenting on the code,
and ordering the functions correctly should be applied to each project so it is
easily understandable, and anyone can add or modify the code if necessary. These
are the tactics from my design approach I will be applying to all of my future
work.
2. How do I approach developing programs?
o What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D
scene?
The first part of my strategy I used when creating my 3D scene was ensuring the
x, y, z coordinates I used made my objects into the correct shapes I wanted to
make. The second part of my strategy was to use the highest quality images for
my textures to make my objects look as realistic as possible. The last part of my
strategy was my light source. I applied diffused lighting to set the brightness and
darkness to my objects in reference to where my light source was located.
o How did iteration factor into your development?
The iteration factor such as while(!glfwWindowShouldClose(window)) ensured
the program stayed running with my objects and background color
o How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the
milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
My approach in developing code was to add a little section of code at a time,
compile, and run the program to ensure it was operating as I intended it to do.
This concept was applied as I was evolving my code from having basic colors to
adding texture. This helped me led to my completed project.
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
o How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge
and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations have given me the fundamentals and
skills I can apply towards more complex graphics which will expand my
knowledge.
o How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge
and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Computational graphics and visualizations gave me the skills and knowledge to
further my skills that could be used for creating innovative video games and
different training exercises using VR...
